## 🚀 Projects

Here are some of the projects I have worked on:

- [🎟️ Event Booking App (Web + Stripe)](https://github.com/miloszpiechota/event-booking-app)  
  A full-stack single-page web application for booking event tickets with real-time availability, Stripe payments, and QR code generation. Built with React, Supabase, Stripe API, Tailwind, and Vite.

- [📱 Ticket Validator Mobile App (React Native + Expo)](https://github.com/miloszpiechota/ticket-qr-scanner)  
  A mobile app that scans and verifies QR-coded tickets using Expo Camera and Supabase. Ensures secure check-in process with hash validation and live status updates in the database.

- [📊 Population Data Analysis Dashboard (R Shiny)](https://github.com/miloszpiechota/bmi-dashboard)  
  Interactive R dashboard visualizing BMI trends and obesity rates using real and synthetic datasets. Features dynamic filtering, WHO data comparison, and PCA-based analytics.

- [🤖 AI & ML Experiments (Colab Notebooks)](https://github.com/miloszpiechota/ai-ml-notebooks)  
  A collection of machine learning notebooks exploring classification, prediction, LSTM for stock data, and neural network architectures using Keras, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow.
